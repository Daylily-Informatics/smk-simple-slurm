## dev

Example that specifies memory in GB instead of MB (`mem-gb`)

## v1.3.0 - 2022-08-09

New status script `status-sacct-robust.sh` that re-runs `sacct` multiple times
if it fails to return a valid status. This is more robust and is recommended if
you notice Snakemake unexpectedly re-submits jobs that are still pending or
running. See [Issue #9][issue-9] for discussion

[issue-9]: https://github.com/jdblischak/smk-simple-slurm/issues/9

Example with [job grouping][grouping]

Example that uses pinned conda environments (`pinned-conda-envs`) (requires
minimum of Snakemake version 7.8.0)

Example that inserts the current date in the log file paths (`log-file-date`)

Example rule with thousands of input files (`many-input-files`)

## v1.2.0 - 2022-03-09

Full support for custom status scripts in a multi-cluster setup (requires
minimum of Snakemake version 7.1.1)

Example with [cluster-cancel][] (requires minimum of Snakemake version 7.0.0)

## v1.1.0 - 2021-09-17

Reduce the default settings for `max-jobs-per-second` and
`max-status-checks-per-second` to avoid stressing Slurm
